<h1 align="left"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:green">ThreatRadar-Pro</span></font></h1>
A structured approach used to identify, assess, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities in a application. It helps organizations understand where their security weaknesses lie and how they might be exploited by attackers. The goal is to design and implement effective security measures to mitigate these threats in design phase.
